# Welcome to the home of the HomeBotOS.
This is where the OS will be maintained and updated, so keep an eye on this if you have a HomeBot. More info about HomeBot [here](http://jalonzpa.github.io).

# The .sh scripts are setups for HomeBot.

For the cprohomebot.sh, this installs Python 2, CHIP_IO v0.5.6, configures the WiFi antenna, and updates Debian so it can install and boot HomeBotOS (more info [here](http://jalonzpa.github.io)).

For the chiphomebot.sh, it does everything as stated above, but without setting up the WiFi antenna.
