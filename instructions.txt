**chicken**
All right. Here's the first thing to do: preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
Rub the chicken all over with salt and pepper. Then, cut slits in the chicken and tuck your herbs in.
Now, put the diced lemon into the cavity.
Put the chicken in a roasting pan, and put it in the oven with the cover on. Let it cook for one to one and a half hours, and then lower the temperature to 350 degrees.
Keep it in until the internal temperature is 165 degrees.
Once you have it out, you can start to pull it apart. Be careful! It's hot! Make sure to pull along the grain, not against it.
You can now serve it in buns, or eat it by itself.
